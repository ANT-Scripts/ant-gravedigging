# **Grave Digging**
This is a QB-Core script for a grave digging job in FiveM.

# **Dependencies**
- QB-Core
- QB-Target

# **Notifications**
- Ox-Lib / QB-Core / Okok Notify

# **Configuration**
Everything is configurable within the `config.lua` file.

# **Features**
- Gravestones (small)
- Tombstones (big)
- Ghost Attacks
- Curses (If a player has a cursed item in their inventory, they will be attacked by a Ghost every `x` minutes)
- Extensive Configuration
- Over 100 robbable grave sites

# **Installation**
It is recommend that you create your own cursed items to fit the theme of your roleplay environment. If you do not want to use the Curse system, you can simply turn it off via the configuration file.
This script is pretty much a drag and drop! Just read the config.lua!
